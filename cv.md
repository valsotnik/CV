### About Myself:

I'm 29 years old.
I graduated from the Belarusian-Russian University in Mogilev, Republic Of Belarus, branch - mechanical engineering.
After that I worked on several diverse jobs, at the moment I am an expert of the Belarusian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Now I want to change direction, the IT sphere has always been interesting to me and the time has come.
I have good communication skills, I am stress-resistant, I work well in a team and am determined to absorb new knowledge.
I will make every effort to finish these courses with dignity and find a job in this direction.
